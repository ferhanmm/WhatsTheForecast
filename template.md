#### Script:
    - Hi this is Mazen and Ferhan from Houston, TX. This is our Final Project for CS50.
    - For our project we chose to develop a weather forecast website.
    - You can reach the website at https://whatstheforecast.com
    - Here's quick demo of how it functions.
        -   Test index.html
        -   Test search feature
    - The site is hosted on Digital Ocean and name is hosted Google Domains.
    - We used GitHub to collaborate development and track code changes.
    - The framework we chose was Flask (app/helpers), for its ease of use and great performance. We use Python to make api calls to weatherapi.com, and process the returned data.
    - Our site is seperated into two pages, the default page displays the users weather forecast based on the IP address contained in their HTTP header. The weather page displays the forecast information based on the users search query.
